# Three bar shapes coexist on one year axis, driven entirely by which cells are
# populated in the source data (see its `flag`/`note` columns, taken from EPA's
# own figure caption):
#   - an ordinary year stacks two segments: construction, other_sectors.
#   - 2019 draws ONE segment (all_industries): BLS combined construction into
#     the all-industry total that year and never published a sector split, so
#     there is a real total (43) but no honest way to split it.
#   - 2020 draws NOTHING: BLS's own data collection fell below its reporting
#     threshold that year and published no total at all.
